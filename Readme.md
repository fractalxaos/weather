<h4>Do-it-yourself Weather Station</h4>
<p>
Building a do-it-yourself (DIY) weather station is an exciting way to learn about the "Internet of Things".  What follows is a detailed project description on how to build your own DIY weather station using low cost, easily available parts, for about $350.  Virtually all the hardware and software used in this project is "open source", allowing great latitude in customizing the weather station to suit your individual needs and application.
</p>
<p>
Building the weather station will give you an excellent introduction to a variety of technologies.  You will learn about programming Arduino micro-controllers, assembling electronic components, and using solar energy to power your project.  You will learn about Linux server software systems and architecture, scripting for Internet applications, and displaying information in a web page.

You can find all the required software available under open source, GNU license at this project site.  Please read the <a href="server_model/docs/DIY Weather Project Description.pdf">project description document</a> for details on procuring the materials, assembling the weather station and installing the software.
